Welcome to the wiki for the HvZ @ RIT website! The website is written in PHP with the Symfony framework (among other dependencies). It has been used in the RIT fall 2014 weeklong game with much success.

This wiki mostly contains documentation on the website's REST API.

**WARNING:** The REST API is unstable at the moment, and subject to change.
