Welcome to the wiki for the HvZ @ RIT website! The website is written in PHP with Symfony2. It was used during the Fall 2014 RIT weeklong game, and supported around 800 players, mods, and administrators.

This wiki mostly contains documentation on the website's REST API.

**NOTE:** The REST API is mostly stable at the moment, though there are a few areas that are likely to change.
