# API documentation for hvzsite

__THIS IS OLD, SEE [HERE](https://github.com/redxdev/hvzsite/tree/master/docs) FOR DOCUMENTATION ON THE NEW VERSION OF THE WEBSITE__

This repository contains the api documentation for hvzsite.

## NOTICE

The API will be undergoing some major upgrades before Spring 2016 as the website is being rewritten. That said, there will likely be a v1-compatable API so writing against these docs shouldn't break anything in the spring.

## Endpoint Location

All endpoints are located at /api/v1/endpoint. For example, if you want the status endpoint and the website is located at https://hvz.rit.edu, then the full URL would be https://hvz.rit.edu/api/v1/status

## Examples

* [hvz-app](https://github.com/redxdev/hvz-app) - App which makes use of the REST api. Works on iOS and Android, written in C# with Xamarin.
* [hvz-cli](https://github.com/liam-middlebrook/hvz-cli) - Command line interface for the API. Written in python.
